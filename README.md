# Light_Level_Overlay
I made a datapack to show the lighting level. 

- Version: 1.17-1.18
- This datapack is very fine-tuned. 
- You just need to:
  - install it in your world;
  - write the command "/reload";
  - enter the command "/trigger light_level.button";
  - And follow the instructions in the chat.
